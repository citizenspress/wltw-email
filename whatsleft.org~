** The case against unions using the word "Millennial"

It's normal for marketing agencies to invent words to capture the essence of an entire generation of potential consumers. It's done regularly. Boomers, Gen Y, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z, they are words meant to generalize the habits of a particularly large segment of the population. Unfortunately, in a world where media is dominated by those who do not identify with younger generations, these identifiers are used to communicate all sorts of stereotypes.

When these words are used in progressive circles – labour unions, activist groups, student spheres – it becomes an easy point of division. While self-identification is important and helps build a diverse and inclusive movement, "Millennial" is a loaded term. In addition to its taint from marketing, "Millennial" it is often used as a pejorative and creates arbitrary barriers to building broader working class solidarity.

There are important reasons to examine the effects of age on an individual's needs in a social and economic context. However, it is important to appreciate that age is a continuum and not everyone is impacted the same way at the same age.

The "Millennial” label, like all of these generational labels, lumps everyone together in an arbitrary category, as if being born a year before or after a predetermined year gives one special super powers of reason or innate ability to use technology. Indeed, no one can even agree about which birth year should mark the beginnings of the Millennial generation.

Despite the difference in age, problems facing anyone that fall outside of the Millennial generation are also replicated among youth. The systems of oppression that affect working people, radicalized people, and women in particular, have not yet been eradicated and are clearly also present among the younger generation.

Numerous studies looking at stereotypes of "young people today" show that most of the issues that faced previous generations continue to impact newer generations. This should be of no surprise to those who understand that neoliberal reforms continue to weaken social safety nets. People engage with society and the economy at the individual level, not as generational groups. Economic and social relationships don’t just suddenly change for those born after 1981.

In progressive organizations, it is more useful to identify people according to their relation to their work. Those new to a job, those in precarious or contract work, those near retirement. This kind of orientation is related to age and those entering (or reentering) the workforce may be older or younger than the median age, but it is their relation to their employment, their economy, and their social group that gives insight into their engagement. Identifying terms such as “Millennial” should not be assigned to people by others.

There will always be reasons why consumer and communications firms refer to various age groups and attempt to generalize their likes, dislikes, habits, buying preferences, or voting characteristics. However, in the effort to build a lasting working class movement through unions and other progressive institutions, words and analysis matter. The trick is to avoid terms like “Millennial” – terms that divide without providing any meaningful information that might advance the movement.

** "Gig Economy" too broad to be meaningful 

There seems to be a willful blindness on behalf of right-wing policy makers and the media when it comes to complexity in the "gig economy". Policy makers pushing through anti-worker deregulation are using technological changes that consumers want as bait, while simultaneously changing regulations and allowing more workers to be exploited in precarious jobs. There is an essential difference between Uber, Airbnb, and the newly growing internet application-driven food delivery services.

Uber, as a company, uses private equity funding to aggressively attack regulation to forward its own profit making. They win when their employees undercut those workers currently in the regulated system – a system full of hard-won regulation brought in to stop the kind of unsustainable race to the bottom Uber is pushing.

Airbnb is not, as a company, aggressively attacking regulatory mechanisms to undermine a highly regulated house-sharing market. Those who use Airbnb are not employees and are not directly undermining a regulated class of worker. While there are those who are operating in a way that is unlawful, that was the case before Airbnb. The main issue for hotel workers is that there are some large-scale property owners acting as hotels and undercutting wages for cleaners by using contracted companies. The answer is hotel-style regulation and enforcement of municipal hotel licensing for larger operators. 

The main issues with Airbnb are compliance with current regulations on grey-market income and standards. We can look to Cuba, which has had an Airbnb-style rent-a-room system since the start of its revolution. It solved the exploitative aspects of their Casa Particulares system through effective regulation and enforcement.

Airbnb will not replace high and medium-end, unionized hotels, however, it might drive competition at the low-end, non-union low regulatory compliance hotels. If small operators are upset with this new competition it is not the workers' issue.

Contract food delivery has always existed as an hyper exploitative process. If anything, the centralization of the distribution of these contracts may make it easier to identify the specific nature of the exploitation and either organize the workers or demand sector standards. Bike messengers in Toronto and other cities have been experimenting with ways to build solidarity and increase standards in their sector for years.

Making the distinctions between these companies are important for organizing, demanding progressive change, and writing regulations that will actually help instead of hinder access to employment. Identifying who the workers are who are being exploited and by whom is also essential for tilting the scales back in favour of workers.

** Oil pipeline promises are a pipe dream

A new report from the Parkland Institute has shown that the promises of meeting the Paris Agreement goals for greenhouse emissions are essentially impossible if new oil export production is brought online. Under the current self-imposed Alberta emissions cap, Parkland shows that there is no need to build a pipeline as there is more than enough current rail and pipeline capacity to meet any new need.

** Brazil coup unravelling 

The slow-motion coup in Brazil is unravelling just as it achieved right-wing control. This week saw the new president – who is replacing Dilma Rousseff as she fights a trumped-up impeachment process – banned from running for office for eight years after he was convicted of corruption.


Meanwhile, Rouseff's defence lawyers have submitted 370 pages of documents that expose weakness of the charges against. The defence is attempting to show that dozens of opposition politicians recently charged with corruption have pushed a campaign of presidential impeachment as a way to divert attention and avoid prosecution.

Canadian unions and social movements have signed onto a letter condemning the coup process as illegal. They are calling on the government of Canada to not recognize the current illegitimate government in Brazil.
